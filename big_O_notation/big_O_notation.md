## Big O Notation

### Why do we need something like Big O Notation?

We need Big O Notation to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. It helps us understand how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases. This is crucial for comparing different algorithms and choosing the most efficient one for a given problem.

### Describe what Big O Notation is.

Big O Notation is a way to describe how fast or slow an algorithm runs as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand the worst-case scenario for how long an algorithm will take to complete or how much memory it will use. This makes it easier to compare different algorithms and choose the best one for a task.
